# Two-Step Form

_A Two-Step form, built with React and Node._

## Getting Started

To begin, navigate to the `root` folder - you can build the react app with Webpack
and install dependencies using command:

```
npm run build
```

To run the application, use command:

```
npm start
```

If you're making changes to the code and want live reloading of the server, use command:

```
npm run dev
```
