# Two-Step Form

_A Two-Step form, built with React and Node._

## Getting Started

After installing the dependencies (i.e. `npm install`) in the root folder and `client`,
you can run the application with command:

```
npm run build
```

```
npm start
```

If you're making changes to the code and want live reloading of the server, use command:

```
npm run dev
```
